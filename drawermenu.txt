In apps that use Material Design, there are two primary options for navigation: tabs and drawers. When there is insufficient space to support tabs, drawers provide a handy alternative.
In Flutter, use the Drawer widget in combination with a Scaffold to create a layout with a Material Design drawer. This recipe uses the following steps:
	1	Create a Scaffold.
	2	Add a drawer.
	3	Populate the drawer with items.
	4	Close the drawer programmatically.

It can be useful to briefly inform your users when certain actions take place. For example, when a user swipes away a message in a list, you might want to inform them that the message has been deleted. You might even want to give them an option to undo the action.
In Material Design, this is the job of a SnackBar. This recipe implements a snackbar using the following steps:
	1	Create a Scaffold.
	2	Display a SnackBar.
	3	Provide an optional action.

1. Create a Scaffold

When creating apps that follow the Material Design guidelines, give your apps a consistent visual structure. In this example, display the SnackBar at the bottom of the screen, without overlapping other important widgets, such as the FloatingActionButton.

The Scaffold widget, from the material library, creates this visual structure and ensures that important widgets donâ€™t overlap.

  appBar: AppBar(
    title: Text('SnackBar Demo'),
  ),
  body: SnackBarPage(), // Complete this code in the next step.
);
